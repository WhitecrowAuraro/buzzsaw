# About
BUZZSAW is a web application for playing music and videos and
organizing them in a library. It is designed to listen your music
anywhere, without syncing your mobile devices. It is written in
html (who'd have thought?), PHP, JS and CSS.  

## Highlights
  - playlists
  - audio visualization
  - showing id3 tags and cover images from file
  - remote player functionality
  - optimized for mobile devices

# Installation

## Upgrade from old version
1. Delete all files from the buzzsaw directory, except: "database.php", "music" and "music_thumb" directory.
2. Copy all files from this archive to your buzzsaw directory, again except "database.php", "music" and "music_thumb" directory.
3. That's it. If you encounter some problems, clear your browser cache and/or execute file scan again (Menu -> "Options" -> "Scan filesystem").

## Setup up a new installation
1. Setup up a web server with PHP interpreter and a mysql server.

   For Debian <= 8 or current Raspian
   ```bash
   apt-get install apache2 php5 php5-mysqlnd libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server
   ```

   or with PHP7 on Debian 9
   ```bash
   apt-get install apache2 php php-mysql libapache2-mod-php mysql-server
   ```

2. Copy all files from this archive into your webserver root directory.
3. Edit the database.php file and enter your mysql database credentials.
4. Grant write access for the web server user www-data to the "music" and "music_thumb" directory.
5. Open the buzzaw directory in your browser. It should ask you to execute the database setup. Click the button to start the setup. After the setup finished, log in leaving the password box empty.
6. Place all your music files into the "music" directory. Go to Menu -> "Options" -> "Scan filesystem". You can play your music without scanning by using the "files" tab inside the menu.

Enjoy your music! :-)
